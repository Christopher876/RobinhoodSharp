## Description

If this is a feature request, you may explain why it should be added but remember that this is an unofficial project. I have very little sway. If you're submitting or suggesting an undocumented endpoint, don't.

For bug reports, please provide as much *relevant* info as possible.

### Test Source

```
// Avoid posting hundreds of lines of source code.
// Edit to just the relevant portions.
// A raw endpoint call would be best but a snippet of your wrapper might also work.
```
