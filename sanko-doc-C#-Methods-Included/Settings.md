# Notification Settings

Push notifications are amazing. ...I just haven't figured them out yet.

# TODO

- Get Notification Settings		`GET /settings/notifications/`
- Put Notification Settings		`PUT /settings/notifications/`
- Add Device					`POST /notifications/devices/`
- Delete device					`DELETE /notifications/devices/{deviceId}/`
- Get Devices					`GET /notificatins/devices/`
